<configuration plugin="chat">
<!--
|    This plugin will let the console react on certain ingame chat messages.
|    - The triggers are handled as regular expressions.
|    - Want to trigger on words? type (foo) as the trigger.
|    - The triggers are case insensitive.
|    - You can include multiple <reaction>'s. The bot will randomly pick one.
|    - This plugin will add a white space before and after the whole sentence
|    
|    Some basic regular expression stuff:
|    ^  = start of line
|    $  = end of line
|    \s = whitespace
|    .  = match any character (1 charachter in length)
|    *   Preceding expression occurs zero or more times  
|    ?   Preceding expression occurs zero or one times  
|    +   Preceding expression occurs one or more times  
|    [] = match any character inside ([abc] match a or b or c)
|    () = match the group of characters inside ( (hello) matches 'foohellofoo' and 'foo hello foo' and 'hello' )
|    |  = an 'or' sign. ( (hi)|(hello) matches '*Hi*' and 'Hello' but not 'Hoi')
|
|
|    Possible variables:
|      - $player
